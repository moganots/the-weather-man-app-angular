# Ui

An Angular app to display an overview of the current weather in selected places

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.12.

## ToDo
1. Enable auto refreshing to show most recently bookmarked city(ies), as currently the entire app has to be refreshed after a city is bookmarked.
2. Secure the OpenWeather APIKey (appid) in the environment.ts and environment.prod.ts file(s)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
